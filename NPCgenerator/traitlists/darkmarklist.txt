Long and twisted teeth
Can't see faces
Constant noisy flatulence
Weeping sores
One cyclopean eye
Sweats constantly and reeks
Blood is living maggots
Thick fur on palms
Long, disturbing tongue tipped with a nail
Skin is like bacon
Flowers wither around
Has no face
Is a living skeleton
Teeth are centipedes, which whisper
Casts no reflection
Coughs up bloody maggots
Has a monstrous shadow
Eats only spoiled food
Burned by holy symbols
Silver pentagram on forehead
Bloated and feverish skin, musky scent
Has extra fingers and toes
Eyes are pools of darkness
Horns
Has a neverhealing, weeping wound
Weeps blood
Is hated by animals
Has extra rows of teeth
Nose has rotten away
Names of Dead Gods carved on skin
Pentagram brands around body
Inverted names of Old Gods around forearm
